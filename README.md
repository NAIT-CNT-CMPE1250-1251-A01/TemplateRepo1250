# CMPE1250 - Fall, 2025

This repository has been set up with an appropriate folder structure for your CMPE1250 class work.

- In-Class Assignments go in the \ICAs folder
- Lab assignments go in the \LABs folder
- Your libraries should only exist in your \Lib folder
- Some data sheets have been provided in the \Datasheets directory; feel free to add to it

## Libraries

You should not be copying your libraries into individual projects. All of your projects should be using the common library files in the \Lib folder; there should only ever be one copy of each library file.

## C File Templates

The main directory of this repository contains ```Library Template.c``` and ```Main Template.c```. These should be used as the starting points for your main.c project files and your various library c files. They contain a title block that must be updated and some starter code that should be helpful.

## A note on submitted assignments

Do not modify your ICAs or labs after they have been submitted. If you are going to use them to experiment or practice for an exam, create a new branch or a new directory. This is your repository, you can modify it and add to it as you need to. However, the contents of the assignment folders on the main branch must be ready for instructors to review at all times.
